Hello Pat,
Did you ever see the concrete stares of everyday?
The lunatic, the hypocrite are all lost in the fray
Can't you see their lives are just like yours?
An unturned stone
An undiscovered door leading to the gift of hope renewed
Eternity for you
The masses of humanity have always had to suffer
The businessman whose master plan controls the world each day
Is blind to indications of his species slow decay
People blow their minds (they choose to resign)
This deformed society is part of the design
It'll never go away, (it's in the cards that way)
The masses of humanity will always have to suffer!
