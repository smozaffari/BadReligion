So here we are again to experience the bitter, scalding end
And we're the only ones who can perceive it
But others sing of beauty and the story that has unfolded
As one that deserves praise and ritual
My pessimistic lines
Your superstitious lives
And the modern ages lies won't absolve you
And the professional truth
And the dear clairvoyant
Youth and, of course, the nightly news
Will deceive you
(Watch out)
