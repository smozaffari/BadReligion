We're global and well fed, the earth's rotating fate is in our head
We're dominant and prominent and all our deities omnipotent,
And immortality is in our mastermind and we destroy everything we can find
And tomorrow when the human clocks stops and the world stops ticking,
We'll be an index fossil, buried in our own debris
We're listless, promiscuous, and life to us is either hit or miss
We're savoir faire and debonair and things we do are done with pride and care
